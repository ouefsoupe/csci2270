Abstraction:
- Focuses on what as apposed to how
- separate logical properties form implementaiton details

EX:
- Driving = logical property
- construction of engine = implementaiton
- 

Abstract data type = A collection of data emelents and the allowable operations  on those elements
ex: 
clockType
    setTime()
    returnTime()
    printTime()

Data Structure:
    -an abstract representation of problem data for computational problem solving
    -A way to store data


Abstract data type example:
    - Vehicle
        -car, boat, train
